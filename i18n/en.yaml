  translation:  <p class="lead">
      I am a curious, recent MSc graduate researcher in Public Administration and Philosophy of Technology. I am trained as a technology ethicist, specialised in the evaluation of technology used by government organisations. I have basic skills in machine learning and have the ambition to connect my evaluations with the technical specifications of applications. <br>
      
      My academic interest lies in the societal impact of technologies, as you are likely to notice when you read my <a target='_blank' href='/blog'>blog posts</a>. My goal in research is to holistically understand the situation of interest, e.g. through technical review, policy analysis, or philosophical review. It is the way I wrap my head around a situation, in order to provide a novel perspective to others. <br>
      
      In previous research (see my <a target='_blank' href='https://essay.utwente.nl/103693/'>MSc thesis</a>) I have focused on the challenge of responsibility that the use of algorithms in public adminstration government technologies creates. For example, two systems of the Dutch tax authorities in the context of the social benefit scandal, System Risk Classification and the Risk Classification Model. Or the policy doctrine of the UK Government Behavioural Insights Unit. <br>
